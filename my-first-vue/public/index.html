    <p>George Washington (February 22, 1732[b] – December 14, 1799) was an American military officer, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president
       of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Appointed by the Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army, Washington led the Patriot forces to victory 
       in the American Revolutionary War, and presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the Constitution of the United States and a federal 
       government. Washington has been called the "Father of the Nation" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the country.[10]</p>

    <p>During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the 
      convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became America’s first president. Realizing that the way he handled the job would impact 
      how future presidents approached the position, he handed down a legacy of strength, integrity and national purpose. Less than three years after leaving office, he 
      died at his Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, at age 67.</p>
